          We’re sure you’ll agree that remaining indoors whilst the sun is beaming outside during lockdown, is becoming rather frustrating for both you and your pet. To help, we’ve put together a series of ways to keep both you and your four-legged friends both entertained and happily distracted during these difficult times.

          Firstly, the benefits
          <small class="text-muted">of keeping your pet busy</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          When your pet is bored, they have a tendency to get into trouble. We are of course their main source of activity and entertainment. If you’re keen to avoid your dogs destructive habits (i.e. chewed shoes and stealing the toilet paper), it is important to keep them distracted as intermittently as possible with different boredom busters.

          Build an
          <small class="text-muted">obstacle course</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Another day of working from home, and your needy floof wants some attention whilst you’re on continuous conference calls. Plan ahead and build an obstacle course using old shoeboxes and duvets, combined with using food as a distraction and hiding tasty treats for your four-legged friend to find. This is a fantastic boredom buster and will keep doggo distracted for hours! Be sure to praise them profusely when they successfully find their hidden food treats to enjoy!

          Long
          <small class="text-muted">walkies</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Regardless of whether your pet is a dog, a cat, a rabbit, or something even more exotic and furry, a long walk is a fantastic distraction for them. Be sure to make use of the full one hour of exercise time that we’re all allowed, and if your pet isn’t used to being walked, there’s nothing stopping you from buying them a lead and collar and introducing them to this wonderful outdoor experience!

       <h3 class="blogPostSubtitle display-4 mt-5 mb-2">
          Sing karaoke
          <small class="text-muted">with your pet</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          We’ve all had that experience where you’re in the car with the radio on, intermittently singing along to some absolute tunes, when all of a sudden your dog decides to join in and sing at the key moment! A fantastic distraction for your pet is to recreate this karaoke vibe, although unfortunately despite your dogs enthusiasm to sing, they may not necessarily have the vocals for the task!

          Virtual pet playdate
          <small class="text-muted">using FaceTime</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Just like humans, animals miss their friends too. Fortunately due to modern technology, both you and your pet can adhere to social distancing whilst still interacting with your pets furry friends over FaceTime during a virtual playdate!
        </p>

       <h3 class="blogPostSubtitle display-4 mt-5 mb-2">
          Have a
          <small class="text-muted">pool party</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
        It’s a glorious sunny day and you and your housemates fancy a cheeky drink in the garden. The only problem is…distracting the dog before you get the booze flowing. So on that note, why don’t you spice up your garden party with a paddling pool or sprinkler for your four-legged friend to entertain itself, whilst team lockdown enjoy “Pimmsoclock!"

        </h3>

        <p>
          When your day is restricted and you’re tasked with ensuring you remain calm and collected despite the world being in lockdown, there’s nothing better than some dedicated bonding time with your pet. Switch on Netflix and snuggle up with your four-legged friend on the sofa for some quality relaxation time!
