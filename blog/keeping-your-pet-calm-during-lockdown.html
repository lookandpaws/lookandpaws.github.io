          Pets, in particular dogs, do not always deal very well with a sudden change in routine. If your four-legged friend is more used to a tranquil home, your constant presence due to working from home can indeed cause your pet to become more stressed and anxious.<br/><br/>Fortunately, we’ve put together a series of steps you can follow, to ensure that things go as smoothly as possible for you and your furry friend during lockdown!
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-4 mt-4">
          Be aware
          <small class="text-muted">of the triggers</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          There are a variety of situations that can provoke anxiety in your pets. These range from loud noises such as the use of vacuum cleaners around the house, to the sound of children running around with excitement, and even the introduction of constant sound from a radio or podcast playing throughout the day.

                  <q>By being aware of these triggers, you can work to limit the impact they have on your pets daily schedule.</q>

        <h3 class="display-4 mt-4">
          Create
          <small class="text-muted">a calm sanctury</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Ensure your four-legged friend has a quiet haven to escape to within your home, whether this is a separate room, or perhaps in your garage or back garden.
        </p>

        <p>
          This will help maintain their healthy mindset, and aid in rebuilding their confidence when anxious moments occur.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-4 mt-4">
          Eating
          <small class="text-muted">is a distraction</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          Prepare a series of kongs, for when an unplanned zoom meeting or phone call occurs.
        </p>

        <h3 class="display-4 mt-4">
          Disable
          <small class="text-muted">your doorbell</small>
        </h3>

        <p>

        </p>

        <h3 class="display-4 mt-4">
          Be risk averse
          <small class="text-muted">with noise</small>
        </h3>

        <p>
          In scenarios where you cannot risk the chance of their being any background noise (think conference calls), it’s important to ensure that your pets are the least likely to cause issue. Dogs can be shut away, whereas cats will make more noise if you attempt to close them away, so in that case you need to hope for the best.
