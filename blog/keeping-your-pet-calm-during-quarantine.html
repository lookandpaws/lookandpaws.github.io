          We all know that pets are super sensitive to human emotions, and during these stressful and anxious times its likely having a bit of an impact on our fur babies! Pets, in particular dogs, do not always deal very well with a sudden change in routine. If your four-legged friend is more used to a tranquil home, your constant presence due to working from home can indeed cause your pet to become more stressed and anxious. Fortunately, we’ve put together a series of steps you can follow, to ensure that things go as smoothly as possible for you and your floof during lockdown!

          Have a Spa day for you and your pet
        </h3>

        <p>
          We have seen all the memes of how ratchet we’re all going to look when we come out of quarantine - hair,  nails, skin - they're all in dire need of a beauty therapists attention! So now’s the perfect time to embrace a mini home pamper treat and why not involve your pet?! Get your roots touched up and wrapped up whilst you give your floof a calming bath. Maybe trim their nails and paint your own to some soothing tunes. Finally, set your hair into rollers whilst you blow dry your pet so both you and your fur babies feel like a million dollars.

          Be aware of the triggers
        </h3>

        <p>
          There are a variety of situations that can provoke anxiety in your pets. These range from loud noises such as the use of vacuum cleaners around the house, to the sound of children running around with excitement, and even the introduction of constant sound from a radio or podcast playing throughout the day. By being aware of these triggers, you can work to limit the impact they have on your pets daily schedule.

          Create a calm sanctuary
        </h3>

        <p>
          Ensure your four-legged friend has a quiet haven to escape to within your home, whether this is a separate room, or perhaps in your garage or back garden. This will help maintain their healthy mindset, and aid in rebuilding their confidence when anxious moments occur.

          Eating is the BEST distraction
        </h3>

        <p>
          Food is a fantastic way to focus your pets attention on something other than causing a disturbance to your home working. If you want to be really clever about things, make use of a slow feeder, or alternatively you can prepare a series of kongs, for when an unplanned zoom meeting or phone call occurs.

       <h3 class="blogPostSubtitle display-4 mt-5 mb-2">
          Disable your doorbell
        </h3>

        <p>
          Despite the fact that the world is currently in lockdown, deliveries to your home may still be occurring, and there's certainly still a possibility that your doorbell might ring (your partner might forget their keys when they head to the supermarket for your essential food shopping).
          <br/>
          The key point here is that your doorbell has the potential to upset your pet, especially if they're anxiety is provoked by other factors during their daily schedule.
        </p>

       <h3 class="blogPostSubtitle display-4 mt-5 mb-2">
          Be risk averse with noise
        </h3>

        <p>
          In scenarios where you cannot risk the chance of their being any background noise (think conference calls), it’s important to make sure that your pets are the least likely to cause issue. Dogs are happy to chill in a room away from you, whereas cats will make more noise if you attempt to close them away, ,in which case you might have to embrace their neediness and pre-warn any potential clients on your meeting calls.

       <h3 class="blogPostSubtitle display-4 mt-5 mb-2">
          Keep calm and carry on
        </h3>
        
        <p>
          Finally, since pets have a tendency to feed off their owners emotional status, try your best to remain calm and collected during lockdown, as this will help ensure your pet retains their normal and healthy mental state. If you both do feel anxious, a cuddle together is always a great way to sooth both of you during this time.
